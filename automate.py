My name is {yourName} and I'm on the Sponsorship team for SpartaHack IV, Michigan State University’s annual student-run hackathon. Last January, we welcomed over 600 student developers from around the country for the third-annual SpartaHack — a weekend where students of all skill levels and disciplines learned new technologies, got creative with tech, and connected with peers and company sponsors.

Since last January, our team has been hard at work on new designs, technologies, and ideas to make our 2018 event even better. We will bring together 500 students from MSU and beyond for another 36-hour coding marathon on the weekend of January 19-21, 2018.

We would love to partner with {company} this year to make SpartaHack IV an even bigger success. In the attached documents you will find more information about SpartaHack and our updated sponsorship packages.

Please let us know whether you are interested in supporting SpartaHack IV. If you would prefer to set up a phone call, let me know when you are available in the next week. We look forward to working with you!
